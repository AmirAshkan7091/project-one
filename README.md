B Up to date is an application that allows the user to select different topics on news and to switch to other news including sports and health.  We have also added 2 specific sections for Covid-19  and a section to search any picture topic, all this without keeping an eye on the headlines for the day in our News Ticker!

## Concept

Description: Basic Web Page with a Menu framework and Handling of APIs particularly focused on News.


Motivation for development? First project to develop with a team in Web Development


User story:  Would you like to be up to date with the News in the world? Then B-Uptodate will show you that and moreâ€¦.!!!

## Process

* Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ajax

* Breakdown of tasks and roles

    * Ajax calls (1 Person)
    * HTML FrameWork (1 Person)
    * HTML Basis and CSS (1 Person)

* Challenges: A new system to coordinate and to collaborate, a lot of preparation and meetings to keep in the loop, within goals but focused on the execution in a timely manner.
Successes: We finished ahead of time, functionality was always taken first, we made sure it was first that the looks, once it was working we focused on making it look best.

## Directions for Future Development

* Create links for the News Ticker
* Create more Menu Options
* Create more links for sports
* Develop Tabs instead of to basic sections (divs)
* Give option to store the layout in local Storage
