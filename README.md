# B UPTODATE Application Overview

This is the first project for our Coding Bootcamp in a Group/Team setting.

Following all requirements for this task we would like to present how this application was planned and its execution:

We started with a simple design and based on the design we started planning on assigning tasks. Immediately after we started working on some ideas for the execution.

Our Idea was to present in an easy way 2 or 3 sections in which, with user interaction, we can show some current events regarding news, sports and Covid-19. We also thought of doing a ticker news to present headline news at the bottom of the page. Since we had 12 days for the completion we focused on what was practical and quick to do and what we had on hand.

We started with the research of the new framework and separately doing trials with the New YorK Times API, at the same time we started working on CSS at the time we completed some HTML.

We had one idea of just keeping one main page for everything and we kept this goal, everything is goint to be in one environment/page, there will be links but those will be external to the application.

Our image below contains the final design of the main page:

Below we list the sections in our project:

- Menu Bar
  - Search Bar
- Main Content Div
  - News Content and Search Results
  - Aout Us and Contact Us
- Footer
  - News Ticker

# Menu Options

Options included on the Menu are:

- Technology
- Politics
- Health
- Sports
- Covid-19 News
- Covid-19 Statistics

# APIS Used

1. New York Times API - News
2. New York Times API - Headlines
3. Rapid API - Sports (Soccer)
4. Pixabay API - General Search

## Concept

Description: Basic Web Page with a Menu framework and Handling of APIs particularly focused on News.

Motivation for development? First project to develop with a team in Web Development

User story: Would you like to be up to date with the News in the world? Then B-Uptodate will show you that and moreâ€¦.!!!

## Process

- Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ajax

- Breakdown of tasks and roles

  - Ajax calls (1 Person)
  - HTML FrameWork (1 Person)
  - HTML Basis and CSS (1 Person)

- Challenges: A new system to coordinate and to collaborate, a lot of preparation and meetings to keep in the loop, within goals but focused on the execution in a timely manner.
  Successes: We finished ahead of time, functionality was always taken first, we made sure it was first that the looks, once it was working we focused on making it look best.

## Directions for Future Development

- Create links for the News Ticker
- Create more Menu Options
- Create more links for sports
- Develop Tabs instead of to basic sections (divs)
- Give option to store the layout in local Storage
